Okay so here we go.

This is an attempt at a proper Python based forum framework for
python-forum.org

The project has the following dependencies;
    - mongoengine
    - flask
    - flask-login
    - flask-browserid

To contribute, fork the project, create a branch, work on an issue or bug, with that issue number as the branch name
Then ask for a pull request.
When I am happy with the work in the pull request, I will merge that into a project branch
Then when it gets reviewed or finished it will be merged into the main tree.
